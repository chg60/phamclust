"""Symmetric matrix class to store pairwise relational data.

Includes some helper functions to allow loading SymMatrix objects from
files or saving them to files. The following representations are
supported: adjacency, squareform, or lower triangle matrices.

Adjacency matrices should be 3-column tables: source, target, weight.
The source and target fields are interpreted as strings, while the
weight is cast to a float. This is the least dense but most portable
way to represent a symmetric matrix.

Squareform matrices are denser than adjacency files, but because
symmetric matrices store redundant information (matrix[source,target]
is the same as matrix[target,source]), this is not the most efficient
representation.

Lower triangle files are the densest matrix representation supported
here. They include the matrix diagonal to allow inference of whether
the matrix is a distance or similarity matrix.
